SLHS 303: SPEECH AND HEARING SCIENCE
California State University, East Bay
Spring 2026 — Full Syllabus Reference

================================================================================
COURSE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

CENTRAL QUESTION (The throughline of the entire course):
"What has to be true for linguistic communication to be worth the energy?"

This question frames everything. Linguistic communication is expensive — it requires:
- Mapping abstract thoughts onto arbitrary symbols
- Sequencing them syntactically
- Executing complex motor plans
- Hoping the listener decodes correctly

Direct action is often cheaper. Every week answers part of this question.

FIRST PRINCIPLE:
"Don't trust experts — including me."

COURSE STRUCTURE:
- 15 weeks organized into 4 Acts plus Foundations and Finale
- Each week features a research article for critical analysis
- Students engage with the Critical Reasoning Mirror for weekly conversations
- Midterm (Week 9) and Final (Finals Week) are synthesis papers built through Mirror conversations

UNIFYING FRAMEWORK: SOURCE-FILTER THEORY
- Source: Vocal folds vibrate, producing F0 (fundamental frequency) + harmonics
- Filter: Vocal tract shapes the sound through resonance, creating formants
- "Language is the song, speech is the instrument"
- The source generates raw material; the filter shapes it into meaning

================================================================================
PARTIAL ANSWERS TO THE CENTRAL QUESTION BY ACT
================================================================================

ACT I (Measurement Confounds):
For communication to be worth the energy, we need reliable ways to measure what's happening.
But measurement itself introduces confounds — intensity, environment, software.
The signal isn't just the voice; it's voice + measurement context.

ACT II (Perception Under Noise):
For communication to be worth the energy, listeners must be able to extract signal from noise.
But perception isn't passive filtering — it's active construction shaped by context and expectation.
The listener's processing is as important as the speaker's production.

ACT III (Voice & Phonation):
For communication to be worth the energy, the voice must carry consistent identity and quality.
But voice quality emerges from multiple interacting parameters.
No single measure captures the whole story.

ACT IV (Articulation & Motor Control):
For communication to be worth the energy, production must be precise enough for perception.
But production and perception are linked — how you hear shapes how you speak.
Individual differences in this link matter clinically.

SYNTHESIS (Final Answer):
For linguistic communication to be worth the energy:
1. The signal must be robust enough to survive degradation (noise, distance, filtering)
2. The measurement tools must not introduce more noise than they remove
3. The listener must actively construct meaning from partial information
4. Production and perception must be calibrated to each other
5. All of this must work across individual differences and clinical populations

The energy is worth it because nothing else achieves the bandwidth, flexibility, and precision of speech.
But speech is fragile — it requires everything to go right.
As clinicians, we intervene when any part of this system breaks down.

  2: `This week's article looks at how speech-language pathologists actually use research in practice — and the gap between what we say we value and what we actually do.

Before we dig in: What's your current sense of what "evidence-based practice" means? And do you think most clinicians follow it? Share your honest impression.`,

  3: `This week we're looking at how vocal intensity — basically, how loud someone speaks — can mess up our measurements of voice quality.

Here's the clinical problem: if a patient speaks quietly during an assessment, does that change what we measure? And if so, can we trust those measurements?

What's your intuition before reading the article?`,

  4: `This week's article examines how room acoustics — specifically reverberation — affect the acoustic measures we use to assess voice quality.

Think about it: you might assess a patient in a quiet clinic room one day and a noisy hospital room the next. Should that matter for your measurements?

What's your sense of how much the recording environment might affect acoustic analysis?`,

  5: `Here's a problem you might not have considered: what if the software you use to analyze voice samples gives different results than another equally valid software?

This week's article compares four different acoustic analysis systems measuring the same voices. Spoiler: they don't agree.

Before we explore the findings, what do you think should happen when different software produces different values for the same voice recording?`,

  6: `This week we're exploring why some types of background noise are harder to listen through than others.

Here's the puzzle: steady noise (like a fan) is annoying but manageable. But speech babble — multiple people talking at once — seems disproportionately difficult. Why might that be?

What's your initial guess about why speech-in-speech might be harder than speech-in-noise?`,

  7: `This week's article looks at how context and expectations shape what we hear — especially when the signal is degraded by noise.

Think about this: if I tell you the next word is about "animals" before playing a noisy recording, does that change what you hear? The research suggests it does.

What's your intuition about how much our expectations influence perception versus just passively receiving sound?`,

  8: `Categorical perception is one of the foundational concepts in speech science: the idea that we perceive speech sounds as discrete categories, even though the acoustic signal is continuous.

But this week's article challenges that assumption. The authors argue that phoneme boundaries are more like gradients than walls.

Before we dig in: what's your current understanding of categorical perception? And does it make sense to you that we'd perceive sounds categorically?`,

  9: `This week we're looking at a meta-analysis that asks: which acoustic measures actually predict how listeners perceive voice quality?

This is clinically crucial — we measure all sorts of things (jitter, shimmer, HNR, CPP), but which ones matter for how the voice actually sounds to people?

What's your prediction? Which acoustic measures do you think would best predict perceived voice quality, and why?`,

  10: `The AVQI — Acoustic Voice Quality Index — is a composite measure that combines multiple acoustic parameters into a single number to represent voice quality.

This week's article asks whether that single number is actually valid. Can one index capture the complexity of voice?

What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of using a composite index versus individual measures?`,

  11: `This week's article reviews what acoustic studies tell us about vowels in both developing speech (children) and disordered speech.

Here's an interesting tension: we know vowels are important for intelligibility, but clinicians often focus more on consonants. Why might that be?

What's your sense of how vowel production changes as children develop, and how it might change in speech disorders?`,

  12: `This week's article explores something surprising: children who only overheard Spanish (without speaking it) still showed better Spanish pronunciation as adults compared to people with no exposure.

This is fascinating for heritage language speakers — passive childhood exposure might leave traces in adult production.

What's your initial reaction to the idea that just hearing a language as a child could affect how you produce it as an adult?`,

  13: `This week's article connects perception and production: it finds that people who are more consistent in how they categorize speech sounds also perform better at understanding speech in noise.

Think about it — the precision of your internal categories might predict how well you handle degraded input.

What's your intuition about why perceptual categorization consistency might relate to speech-in-noise performance?`,

  14: `This week we're looking at how nasalance — the resonance in your nasal cavity — affects measures of voice quality like CPP and HNR.

Here's the problem: CPP is supposed to measure laryngeal function, but if nasal resonance changes CPP values, can we trust what it's telling us?

Before we explore the findings, what's your sense of whether resonance should affect phonation measures?`,

  15: `We've reached the final week. This article is about best practices for conducting high-quality acoustic analysis — essentially, how to do this work reliably in clinical and research settings.

Looking back at everything we've covered (measurement confounds, perception, voice quality, articulation), what do you think are the most important factors for ensuring acoustic measurements are trustworthy?`,
