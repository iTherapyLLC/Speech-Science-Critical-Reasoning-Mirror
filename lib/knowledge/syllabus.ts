SLHS 303: SPEECH AND HEARING SCIENCE
California State University, East Bay
Spring 2026 — Full Syllabus Reference

================================================================================
COURSE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

CENTRAL QUESTION (The throughline of the entire course):
"What has to be true for linguistic communication to be worth the energy?"

This question frames everything. Linguistic communication is expensive — it requires:
- Mapping abstract thoughts onto arbitrary symbols
- Sequencing them syntactically
- Executing complex motor plans
- Hoping the listener decodes correctly

Direct action is often cheaper. Every week answers part of this question.

FIRST PRINCIPLE:
"Don't trust experts — including me."

COURSE STRUCTURE:
- 15 weeks organized into 4 Acts plus Foundations and Finale
- Each week features a research article for critical analysis
- Students engage with the Critical Reasoning Mirror for weekly conversations
- Midterm (Week 9) and Final (Finals Week) are synthesis papers built through Mirror conversations

UNIFYING FRAMEWORK: SOURCE-FILTER THEORY
- Source: Vocal folds vibrate, producing F0 (fundamental frequency) + harmonics
- Filter: Vocal tract shapes the sound through resonance, creating formants
- "Language is the song, speech is the instrument"
- The source generates raw material; the filter shapes it into meaning

WEEK 2: EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE
- Article: "Evidence-Based Practice in Speech-Language Pathology" (Greenwell & Walsh)
- Key finding: Training predicts EBP use (p < .05), but only explains 17% of variance

WEEK 3: ACOUSTIC PERTURBATION MEASURES
- Article: "Acoustic Perturbation Measures Improve with Increasing Vocal Intensity" (Brockmann-Bauser et al.)
- Key finding: Jitter and shimmer values change with loudness, even in healthy voices
- Critical thinking: If measurements change with intensity, how do we interpret clinical data?
- Partial answer: The measurement tool itself introduces variables we must control

WEEK 4: REVERBERATION & MEASUREMENT STABILITY
- Article: "Sensitivity of Acoustic Voice Quality Measures in Simulated Reverberation" (Yousef)
- Key finding: Different voice measures have different sensitivity to room acoustics
- Critical thinking: How do we standardize measurements across clinical settings?

- Key finding: Same voice → different software → different values
- Critical thinking: What does this mean for research replication? Clinical benchmarks?
- Partial answer: The tools we use to measure shape what we find

WEEK 6: NOISE VS. SPEECH MASKING
- Article: "Predictors of Susceptibility to Noise and Speech Masking" (Lalonde & Werner)
- Key finding: Speech maskers (babble) are harder to filter than steady-state noise
- Critical thinking: Why might speech-in-speech be harder than speech-in-noise?
- Partial answer: Listeners actively process competing signals, not just filter noise

WEEK 7: CONTEXT IN SPEECH-IN-NOISE
- Article: "Effect of Contextual Information on Speech-in-Noise Perception" (Roushan et al.)
- Key finding: Context and expectations shape what we perceive

- Critical thinking: What does this mean for how we teach articulation?
- Partial answer: Categories are imposed by listeners, not inherent in the signal

WEEK 9: ACOUSTIC VOICE QUALITY META-ANALYSIS

- Key finding: CPP/CPPS are strong predictors of perceived voice quality
- Critical thinking: Why might a composite measure work better than individual measures?
- Partial answer: Voice quality emerges from multiple interacting parameters

WEEK 10: AVQI VALIDITY
- Article: "Meta-Analysis on the Validity of the Acoustic Voice Quality Index" (Barsties et al.)

- Article: "Production Benefits of Childhood Overhearing" (Knightly et al.)
- Key finding: Passive childhood exposure affects adult phonetic production (VOT)
- Critical thinking: What does this mean for heritage language speakers?
- Partial answer: Language exposure shapes production even without explicit learning

WEEK 13: CATEGORIZATION CONSISTENCY
- Article: "Consistency in Phonetic Categorization Predicts Speech-in-Noise Perception" (Rizzi & Bidelman)
- Key finding: Individual differences in categorical consistency predict SIN performance
- Critical thinking: How might this inform intervention for people who struggle in noise?
- Partial answer: Perception-production links are individual, not universal

WEEK 14: NASALANCE EFFECTS ON CPP
- Article: "The Impact of Nasalance on Cepstral Peak Prominence and HNR" (Madill et al.)

KEY CONCEPTS GLOSSARY
================================================================================

ACOUSTIC MEASURES:
- F0: Fundamental frequency (rate of vocal fold vibration)
- Jitter: Cycle-to-cycle variation in F0 (perturbation)

- Masking: When one sound interferes with detection/recognition of another
- Speech-in-noise (SIN): Listening to speech with competing background
- Context effects: How expectations and surrounding information shape perception

METHODOLOGICAL CONCEPTS:
- Confound: Variable that affects results but wasn't controlled
- Reliability: Consistency of measurement
- Validity: Whether measure captures what it claims to
- Effect size: Magnitude of relationship (not just significance)
- Variance explained: How much of the outcome is accounted for by predictors

================================================================================
PARTIAL ANSWERS TO THE CENTRAL QUESTION BY ACT
================================================================================

ACT I (Measurement Confounds):
For communication to be worth the energy, we need reliable ways to measure what's happening.
But measurement itself introduces confounds — intensity, environment, software.
The signal isn't just the voice; it's voice + measurement context.

ACT II (Perception Under Noise):
For communication to be worth the energy, listeners must be able to extract signal from noise.
But perception isn't passive filtering — it's active construction shaped by context and expectation.
The listener's processing is as important as the speaker's production.

ACT III (Voice & Phonation):
For communication to be worth the energy, the voice must carry consistent identity and quality.
But voice quality emerges from multiple interacting parameters.
No single measure captures the whole story.

ACT IV (Articulation & Motor Control):
For communication to be worth the energy, production must be precise enough for perception.
But production and perception are linked — how you hear shapes how you speak.
Individual differences in this link matter clinically.

SYNTHESIS (Final Answer):
For linguistic communication to be worth the energy:
1. The signal must be robust enough to survive degradation (noise, distance, filtering)
2. The measurement tools must not introduce more noise than they remove
3. The listener must actively construct meaning from partial information
4. Production and perception must be calibrated to each other
5. All of this must work across individual differences and clinical populations

The energy is worth it because nothing else achieves the bandwidth, flexibility, and precision of speech.
But speech is fragile — it requires everything to go right.
As clinicians, we intervene when any part of this system breaks down.
